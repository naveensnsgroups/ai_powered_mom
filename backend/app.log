We completed the user authentication module last week and it seems currently testing best. John can you give me an update on the backend API integration? John here, yes the API integration is about 80% completed. I should have it finished by Friday this week. However, I am running into same issues with the payment gateway integration that might delay us by a few days. Thanks John. Lisa, how are you doing and the design makeups for the dashboard? This is Lisa speaking. I completed the main dashboard design and user profile screens I still need to work the stating page which I plan to finish Tuesday next week I will send the final design John by Wednesday so he can start implementation Great Mike, any concerns from QA side? Mike here, I've been starting authentication module and found three minor bugs needed to fix John. I will send you bug report today. We should plan for all regression test cycle next Thursday. Perfect! Let me summarize our action items. John will complete the IP integration by Friday. Fix UABucks. Lisa will finish the setting page design by Tuesday. And deliver final Wednesday. Mike will send bug report today and schedule regression testing for next day. Our main deadline is today most, a cold rest on December 15th. Based on today's decision, we should be tracked if we stick this in practice. Any risks or blockers we need to discuss, don't mention the payment gateway delay. That's a medium priority risk-bearing mentor. Alright, just plan to meet again next Monday. At the same time, thanks everyone for updates.' (duration: 131.34s)
